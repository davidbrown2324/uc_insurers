# Where is the University of California Getting it's Insurance?

In September 2019 the University of California (UC) declared a climate emergency, but its choice of commercial banks and insurance companies is at odds with UC’s stated values.

Currently, the UC ignores Environment, Social and Governance (ESG principles) in selecting commercial insurance services. Some of our insurance companies not only invest in the fossil fuels, they also cover projects to expand the industry such as the construction of new oil pipelines. The two largest recipients of insurance contracts from UC, Liberty Mutual and Tokio Marine, are at the bottom of the pack in their climate policies, receiving combined scores of zero and two on their underwriting, investment and climate leadership. We respectfully request that UC’s Chief Financial Officer issues a Request for Proposals for commercial banking and insurance services that includes a meaningful criterion of adherence to ESG principles. We note that UC is already applying these principles to its investment portfolio. Three months ago the Academic Senate’s highest body, the Academic Council, unanimously requested the administration to follow ESG principles in choosing commercial banking vendors, and to date, the administration has not responded. Why not?
