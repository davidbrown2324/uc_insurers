# The University of California's biggest insurers do not score well on climate issues.

The production of carbon dioxide through the burning of fossil fuels is driving global heating at a rate that is incompatible with a hospitable planet.
Fossil fuel companies continue to mine and extract against the best interest of our species.
The University of California (UC) has recognized the self destructive nature of fossil fuel extraction, and has pledged to withdraw its investments from this industry.
However, fulfilment of our stated aim to provide "long-term societal benefits" requires more action.

Even without investing directly in the fossil fuel industry, UC continues to support its expansion financially.
This support is provided through insurance contracts and it urgently needs to change.
This report summarizes the UC's current insurance policies, focusing on the insurance companies that provide them.
It then examines the policies of these insurance companies (if any exist) with regards to climate and the fossil fuel industry.
This approach reveals that our largest contracts are currently with companies that do not serve the UC's role in society.

## Where do we get our insurance?

The UC is a complicated institution to insure.
There are staff, students, buildings, hospitals and patients, intellectual property across multiple campuses across a large geographical area.
We therefore require a large number of insurance policies from multiple providers.
We asked the UC's Risk Services Office to provide us with the details of our insurance contracts.
The raw data we received in response is available here.
Spending can be grouped into three categories.
1. Homemade policies
2. Store-bought policies
3. Brokers

For risks that are more specific to our institution it is cheaper and faster to design our own policies and then ask companies to cover them.
These 'homemade' policies are handled by the UC's own insurance company called FiatLux. For risks that are faced by most large institutions, insurance companies provide policies that can be adapted to suit UC. I refer to these as 'store-bought'. This section can be further divided into based on whether the policies cover 'construction' which has a different set of risks compared to the day to day function of the UC. Finally, brokers help to handle the negotiations between clients and the insurance providers.

UC spending in the first two categories is summarized below.

__Figure 1. UC's top spending by category.__
The five biggest insurance expenses by company are shown for 'homemade' coverage bought by FiatLux and 'store-bought' coverage bought by the Regents / UCOP directly. For policies covering construction, the three biggest expenses by company are shown. Insurance spending has been totaled by parent company.

From this summary we can see UC turns to insurance giant Liberty Mutual to insure construction as well as day to day coverage of the University. Through multiple contracts, Liberty end up being the UC's top insurer (Figure 2). Similarly, we have multiple contracts with our second most expensive insurance provider Tokio Marine or its subsidiaries (e.g. Philadelphia).

## How do these companies perform on climate issues?

Every year, [Rainforest Action Network](https://www.ran.org/) survey insurance companies, scoring their practices against one another on panel of climate relevant metrics.
The metrics can be grouped into three categories.
1. Underwriting
2. Investment
3. Climate Leadership

_An insurance company that is serious about averting the catastrophic heating of our planet should not enter into a contract that will pay out if the construction of a new oil rig or coal mine goes awry. Climate conscious insurers should have an internal policy that restricts them from underwriting projects to expand the fossil fuel industry. Furthermore, continued coverage for the fossil fuel industry's existing assets (business as usual) is not consistent with the rate and severity of climate change._
Thankfully some insurance companies have started to adopt policies that limit underwriting of fossil fuels. In the rankings below higher scores are assigned to policies restricting a wider variety of fossil fuels (oil, coal, tar sands) and to more stringent and pervasive commitments.

__Figure 3. Insurance companies ranked by their policies on Underwriting.__
Data from the 2019 Rainforest Action Network Scorecard. Insurance Companies are scored based on the extent to which their policies restrict them from underwriting fossil fuels.

_An insurance company that is serious about averting the catastrophic heating of our planet should not invest their capital in an industry dedicated to the extraction, transport or combustion of fossil fuels. Climate conscious insurers should have an internal policy that restricts them from investing in the fossil fuel industry._
From the UC's perspective buying insurance from a company that continues to invest in the fossil fuel industry (business as usual) is an absurd act. That money is then funding the expansion of an industry that drives global heating and increases the frequency and severity of natural disasters that are already affecting our campuses. This year UC, Santa Cruz and UC, Irvine were evacuated due to forest fires. Thankfully some insurance companies have started to adopt policies that limit investment in fossil fuels. In the rankings below higher scores are assigned to policies restricting a wider variety of fossil fuels (oil, coal, tar sands) and to more stringent and pervasive commitments.

_If we expect to inhabit a hospitable planet, everyone has a part to play in reversing climate change. Faced with a wealthy industry that has willfully deceived the public about the threat of global warming [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2), Insurance Companies play key role. In many cases fossil fuel companies can afford to run and even expand, all the while continuing to accelerate global heating. However, most fossil fuel companies cannot afford to cover mishaps, disasters and pandemics out of pocket, and so depend heavily on Insurance. Insurance Companies are therefore perfectly positioned to demonstrate their leadership combating climate change._
Thankfully some insurance companies have started to rise to that challenge. In the rankings below higher scores are assigned for alignment with climate science, public, time-bound climate commitments, climate conscious lobbying and proactive investment in renewable energy.

## So how do our biggest insurers score?

Looking at the positions of UC's top insurers in the Rainforest Action Networks rankings, we can see that our biggest contracts are not with the best companies.

__Figure 7. Ranking of UC Insurance Companies.__
Data from the 2019 Rainforest Action Network Scorecard were intersected with public data on UC's insurance companies.

## Conclusions

1. UCs largest insurance deals are with two of the worst performers in terms of climate (Figure 7).
2. These large payments are already subdivided into multiple separate contracts (Figure 1).
3. UC already has contracts with other insurance companies of a similar size (Figure 1).
4. There are insurance companies of comparable size with better climate and ESG records than our top insurers (Figure 6).

## Proposal

The UC could make a significant impact year on year by introducing ESG policies with meaningful climate criteria. Simply by moving contracts from the worst performers Liberty Mutual and Tokio Marine to better performers like Zurich, we would be removing our unbridled support for fossil fuel expansion, helping to stem the toxic combustion of fossil fuels. Our action would nudge insurance companies towards policies in line with the Paris agreement, and nudge other Universities and centers of education to consider their own insurance policies. In the coming years, the velocity and extent with which insurance companies transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energies will become an informative metric allowing us to reward best practices rather than simply avoiding the worst. Until then, avoiding the worst is the least we should do.
