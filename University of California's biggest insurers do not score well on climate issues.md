# The University of California's biggest insurers do not score well on climate issues.

The production of carbon dioxide through the burning of fossil fuels is driving global heating at a rate that is incompatible with a hospitable planet. 
Fossil fuel companies continue to mine and extract against the best interest of our species. 
The University of California (UC) has recognised the self destructive nature of fossil fuel extraction, and has pledged to withdraw its investments from this industry. 
However, fulfilment of our stated aim to provide "long-term societal benefits" requires more action. 

Even without investing directly in the fossil fuel industry, UC continues to support its expansion financially.
This support is provided through insurance contracts and it urgently needs to change.
This report summarises the UC's current insurance policies, focusing on the insurance companies that provide them.
It then examines the policies of these insurance companies (if any exist) with regards to climate and the fossil fuel industry.
This approach reveals that our largest contracts are currently with companies that do not serve the UC's role in society.

## Where do we get our insurance?

The UC is a complicated insitution to insure. 
There are staff, students, buildings, hospitals and patients, intellectual property across multiple campuses across a large geographical area.
We therefore require a large number of insurance policies from multiple providers.
We asked the UC's Risk Services Office to provide us with the details of our insurance contracts. 
The raw data we recieved in response is available here.
Spending can be grouped into three categories.
1. Homemade policies
2. Store-bought policies
3. Brokers

For risks that are more specific to our insitution it is cheaper and faster to design our own policies and then ask companies to cover them. 
These 'homemade' policies are handled by the UC's own insurance company called FiatLux. For risks that are faced by most large insitutions, insurance companies provide policies that can be adapted to suit UC. I refer to these as 'store-bought'. This section can be further divided into based on whether the policies cover 'construction' which has a different set of risks compared to the day to day function of the UC. Finally, brokers help to handle the negotiations between clients and the insurance providers.

UC spending in the first two categories is summarized below.

__Figure 1. UC's top spending by category.__
The five biggest insurance expenses by company are shown for 'homemade' coverage bought by FiatLux and 'store-bought' coverage bought by the Regents / UCOP directly. For policies covering construction, the three biggest expenses by company are shown. Insurance spending has been totaled by parent company.

## Conclusions

## Proposal

The UC could make a significant impact year on year by introducing ESG policies with meaningful climate criteria. Simply by moving contracts from the worst performers Liberty Mutual and Tokio Marine to better performers like Zurich, we would be removing our unbridled support for fossil fuel expansion, helping to stem the toxic combusion of fossil fuels. Our action would nudge insurance companies towards policies in line with the Paris agreement, and nudge other Universities and centers of education to consider their own insurance policies. In the coming years, the velocity and extent with which insurance companies transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energies will become an informative metric allowing us to reward best practices rather than simply avoiding the worst. Until then, avoiding the worst is the least we should do.
