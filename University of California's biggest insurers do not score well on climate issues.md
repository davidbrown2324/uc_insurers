# The University of California's biggest insurers do not score well on climate issues.

The production of carbon dioxide through the burning of fossil fuels is driving global heating at a rate that is incompatible with a hospitable planet. 
Fossil fuel companies continue to mine and extract against the best interest of our species. 
The University of California (UC) has recognised the self destructive nature of fossil fuel extraction, and has pledged to withdraw its investments from this industry. 
However, fulfilment of our stated aim to provide "long-term societal benefits" requires more action. 

Even without investing directly in the fossil fuel industry, UC continues to support its expansion financially.
This support is provided through insurance contracts and it urgently needs to change.
This report summarises the UC's current insurance policies, focusing on the insurance companies that provide them.
It then examines the policies of these insurance companies (if any exist) with regards to climate and the fossil fuel industry.
This approach reveals that our largest contracts are currently with companies that do not serve the UC's role in society.

## Where do we get our insurance?

The UC is a complicated insitution to insure. 
There are staff, students, buildings, hospitals and patients, intellectual property across multiple campuses across a large geographical area.
We therefore require a large number of insurance policies from multiple providers.
We asked the UC's Risk Services Office to provide us with the details of our insurance contracts. 
The raw data we recieved in response is available here.
Spending can be grouped into three categories.
1. Store-bought policies
2. Homemade policies
3. Brokers

For risks that are faced by most large insitutions, insurance companies provide policies that can be adapted to suit UC. I refer to these as 'store-bought'. 
This section can be further divided into based on whether the policies cover 'construction' which has a different set of risks compared to the day to day function of the UC.
For risks that are more specific to our insitution it is cheaper and faster to design our own policies and then ask companies to cover them. 
These 'homemade' policies are handled by the UC's own insurance company called FiatLux.
Finally, brokers help to handle the negotiations between clients and the insurance providers.

UC spending in these categories is summarized below.

Our spending with each company is shown below.
